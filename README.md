# NYC_taxi_analysis
Using public taxi data from New York City, I developed a complete automation and data analysis project.
A web scraping process was created in Python to automate the download of the files, followed by a data cleaning and standardization pipeline, also in Python.
The datasets were converted to Parquet format to ensure faster and more efficient reading in Power BI.
The analysis explores various aspects such as trip duration, payment types, pickup and drop-off locations, tipping behavior, among other patterns.Using public taxi data from New York City, I developed a complete automation and data analysis project.
